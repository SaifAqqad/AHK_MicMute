## Usage

On the first run, you will be asked to set up MicMute:

![](./src/assets/firstsetupdialog.png)

Click OK and a new configuration window will open:

![](./src/assets/configwindow_1.png)

1. Choose your microphone from the drop down list.

2. Choose whether you want separate hotkeys for Mute and Unmute or a single Toggle/Push-to-talk hotkey.

3. Based on your choice, you will either need to setup both hotkeys or just one of them.
        
   - Click on 'Record' then press the key(s) you want (press without holding them).
   - Turn on 'Wildcard' if you want the hotkey to be fired even if extra modifiers/keys are held down.
   - Turn on 'Passthrough' if you don't want the key's native function to be blocked/hidden from the system.
   - Turn on "Advanced hotkey" if you want to enter a hotkey string using AHK syntax instead (see [AHK docs](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm)).
   
4. Choose whether you want sound feedback when muting/unmuting the microphone or on-screen feedback or both.

   </details>

5. Choose whether you want the OSD to exclude fullscreen apps/games (this is needed for games that lose focus when the OSD is shown).

6. Set up "AFK Timeout" if you want it to automatically mute the microphone when you idle for longer than a set interval (in minutes).

7. Click "Save Config"


<details><summary><b>You can also write/edit the config file in a text editor:</b></summary> 

###### config.ini

```ini
[settings]
Microphone=""
MuteHotkey=""
UnmuteHotkey=""
PushToTalk=
SoundFeedback=
OnscreenFeedback=
ExcludeFullscreen=
UpdateWithSystem=
afkTimeout=
```

1. `Microphone` can be any substring of your microphone's name or the controller's name as shown in this image:
   <details><summary>image</summary>

   ![](./src/assets/Controlpaneldialog.png)

   </details>
   
   you can also leave it as `""` to select the default microphone
### 
2. Both `MuteHotkey` and `UnmuteHotkey` can be any hotkey supported by AHK, use this [List of keys](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm) as a reference, you can also combine them with [hotkey modifiers](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm#Symbols).

   You can set both to the same hotkey to make it a toggle.


   Examples: `"<^M"`: left ctrl+M, `"RShift"`: right shift, `"^!T"`: ctrl+alt+T, `"LControl & XButton1"`: left ctrl+ mouse 4


3. Set `PushToTalk` to `1` to enable PTT,  `MuteHotkey` and `UnmuteHotkey` need to be set to the same hotkey first.

4. Both `SoundFeedback` and `OnscreenFeedback` can be set to either `0` or `1`, you can also set `ExcludeFullscreen` to 1 to stop the OSD from showing on top of fullscreen applications

   </details>
   
5. If `UpdateWithSystem` is set to 1, the tray icon will update whenever the microphone is muted/unmuted by the OS or other applications, it increases CPU usage by 1% at most
